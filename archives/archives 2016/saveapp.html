      <h3> Save App: Mobile UX | UI </h3>

        <h4>The 5-Second Pitch</h4>
        <p>Save (iOS app) empowers users to find the best deals online and in-store. Using image recognition, Save automatically pulls up similar items and gives the user a clear picture of the tradeoffs between price and shipping time.</p>
      </br>
        <h4>The Challenge</h4>
        <p>To design the user journey from end to end, starting from user personas/storyboarding all the way to high fidelity mockups.</p>
      </br>
        <h4>Identifying Stakeholders and Users </h4>
        <p><span style="font-weight:bold">Stakeholder concerns: </span>The main concern is of similar apps on the market. RedLaser and ShopSavvy are the most well known apps with similar functions. However, a look through the reviews on the App Store show many user complaints surrounding the user experience. There are constant complaints of app crashes and slowness of scanning, as well as a less than intuitive user interface.</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight:bold">User interviews: </span> The main painpoints identified included 1)not being able to locate which items are in store without having to go to specific brand sites 2)not having one place to find comprehensive view of all prices + all deals and having to wait for shipping time if bought online.</p>

        <p><span style="font-weight:bold">To solve these concerns: </span>1)make clear the tradeoffs between shipping time and price-in-store, and 2)attempt to remedy the problem of a glitchy user experience. </p>
      </br>
        <h4>Understanding the Target Market</h4>
        <p>According to AdWeek, 81% of shoppers conduct online research before they make a purchase (2014). On average, 61% will read product reviews before making any purchase, and a consumer will visit 3 stores before making their purchase.</p>
        <p>According to <a href="http://www.adweek.com/socialtimes/81-shoppers-conduct-online-research-making-purchase-infographic/208527"> Adweek</a>, there are also a number of reasons why users choose not to make a purchase at an online store:</p>
        <ul class="quote">
          <li>69% avoid purchasing because they believe returning a product would be a complicated process.</li>
          <li>61% of shoppers would leave a website if it didn’t have free shipping.</li>
          <li>51% of shoppers would abandon a purchase if shipping options weren’t fast enough.</li>
          <li>6 in 10 consumers said they were concerned about credit-card fraud.</li>
        </ul>
        <p> <a href="https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/research-studies/mobile-path-to-purchase-5-key-findings.html">Think With Google</a> also provides a number of interesting stats on the consumer shopping experience:</p>
        <ul class="quote">
          <li>Search is the most common starting point for mobile research.</li>
          <li>On average a consumer spends over 15 hrs researching on mobile per week.</li>
          <li>Location proximity matters to consumers on mobile: 69% of consumers expect businesses to be within 5 miles or less of their location.</li>
          <li>Mobile influences purchases across channels. 93% of consumers who use mobile to research their purchase decisions go on to make a purchase. Most purchases happen in physical stores.</li>
        </ul>
        <p> Therefore we can infer 1) a majority of shoppers research their purchases before buying 2) are concerned with shipping costs &amp; speed, as well as return process 3) are also concerned with security in online transactions.</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight:bold">The Personas: </span>Jenn, a smart, savvy consumer who wants to save money. Already actively searches for deals online and always looks up coupon codes before clicking purchase. Primary concern with purchases are of price and whether she will be able to obtain the item immediately. John, a big ticket spender who needs something immediately for a gift. Primary concern is speed of which he will be able to obtain an item, rather than price.</p>

    <h4>Low Fidelity: Rough Mock Ups of All Flows</h4>
    <div class="projectimage">
      <img src="images/uxportfolio/saveapp/roughsketch.jpg"/>
    </div>
    <p> Since paper prototyping is the fastest method to get my ideas into a tangible format, I chose to sketch out all the major interactions in the Save app on paper to start out. These flows included onboarding, signup/login, scanning items, and price comparison.</p>

      <h4>Usability Tests</h4>
      <p> After 2 user tests in class administered by another classmate of mine, I tested three users on usertesting.com with the new version of my app, with only two demographic specifications: location (USA) and mobile operating system (iOS).</p>
      <p> Test Context: All three users were informed that Save was an iOS app that empowered users to find the best deals online and in stores. They were instructed to walkthrough the main flow of the app (scan-navigate to store / add to online cart) and were asked about details on the page. They were then asked to submit responses to a post-test questionaire to evaluate their experience. </p>
      <p> Test Goals:The goal of these three tests were to understand the most important flow (from scan to navigate) and the pain points along the process, as I had already tested v1 in class during user testing day. I wanted to see whether the new layout for filtering/ bottom nav/ tab view of in store and online conveyed the information better than in v1 of my app. I also wanted to understand if users were having any difficulties within this process, and if the prototype flow made sense. </p>
      <p> Test Results:
        Users understood most iconography, however it was mentioned directly that the chat icon could benefit from a label to explain what it could do (for those that skipped the tutorial). For all users, it was relatively easy to find the filters, but could still use improvement to clarify. Users explicitly stated they found the app relatively easy to use, and appreciated the aesthetic of the app. Users also mentioned the need for a direct search option (when they didn't want to look up an item via image recognition), and additional information on special sales. </p>

          <li> user engagement with filtering of items </li>
          <li> user survey feedback on satisfaction with app and usefulness of app </li>
