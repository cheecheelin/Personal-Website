      <h3> Toast Design Challenge </h3>
      <div class="projectimage">
        <img src="images/uxportfolio/toast/toastcover.jpg"/>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>The Challenge</h4>
        <p>As part of my interview process, I was asked to redesign the Toast workflow.</p>
        <p>note: I designed these tablet screens with the Google Material Design guidelines in mind, as the Toast POS works via a Samsung tablet. </p>
      </br>
        <h4>The Flow</h4>
        <p>I decided to tackle two main flows, ordering and seating. I chose these two flows because of my limitations in user base sample, and these two flows interface somewhat with customers. As I do not have contacts who currently use the Toast POS, I decided that I would base my initial design off of users that either a) had experience in ordering at restaurants or b) served as a waiter in a restaurant. Below, I've included a high level overview of my end result. </p>
        <div class="projectimage">
          <img src="images/uxportfolio/toast/flow1.png"/>
        </div>
        <div class="projectimage">
          <img src="images/uxportfolio/toast/flow2.png"/>
        </div>

      </br>
        <h4>In Depth Interviews</h4>
        <p>To tackle these two flows, I first had to identify <span style="font-weight: bold"> what problem I was trying to solve</span>. I've included two main personas below: the first being a hungry customer waiting at a restaurant, and the second someone who works in the food service industry.</p></br>
        <!-- ENTER PERSONA IMAGE HERE -->
        <h4>Persona Based User Case Scenario: Seating Flow</h4>
        <p><span style="font-weight: bold">(Problem)</span> Customers of the restaurant often arrive at a restaurant hungry and have to endure a long wait to get their food. There is a lack of perceived transparency for wait time between restaurant and customer. </br> <span style="font-weight: bold">(Problem)</span> Waiters at the restaurant input the customer's name and do not have an efficient way of allocating empty tables and estimating accurate wait time to the customers, which starts a stressful cycle of customers being impatient and continuously checking to see what place they are on the list</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: bold">(Design Opportunity)</span> If we can improve this flow and accurately gauge wait times as well as streamline the seating process, customers satisfaction will increase and waiters will also be able to focus on serving the customers rather than managing the wait time. </p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: bold">(Entry Point)</span> Waiters will be empowered through the Toast POS and subsequently be able to inform customers accurately of their wait status and seat them efficiently. A future extension of the implementation could be through a screen that displays necessary information to the restaurant customers as well. </p></br>

        <h4>Wireframe Sketches: Seating Flow</h4>
        <p>Wireframe sketches were made to outline the general flow and gestures needed to complete this seating flow. Some important features that would help ease the uncertainty between customer/waiter included an estimated time to be seated timer, and a timestamp that would allow the waiter to have an overview of the time that customers have been waiting. In addition, a seating map that would display the available tables would also be included.</p>
        <div class="projectimage">
          <img src="images/uxportfolio/toast/sketch.jpg"/>
        </div>
        <h4>Low Fidelity Mockups &amp; Motion: Seating Flow</h4>
        <p>To test out my initial direction with the seating flow, I created low fidelity mockups as well as a clickable prototype in Principle with minimal elements to see if the flow made sense to users.</p>
        <video width="100%" autoplay controls loop>
          <source src="images/uxportfolio/toast/imtoast.mp4" type="video/mp4" >
        </video>
        <p>Initial feedback included: a) the waiter might be moving around as he/she is assigning people to tables, so drag might not be the best option b) time of arrival might not be as beneficial information as time elapsed.</p></br>

        <h4>Incorporating Feedback &amp; High Fidelity Mockups: Seating Flow</h4>
        <div class="projectimage">
          <img src="images/uxportfolio/toast/seatingscreens.jpg"/>
        </div>
        <p>I added in elements of Toast's branding as well as changed the interaction element from drag to tap to reflect the feedback received. </p> </br>

        <!-- Ordering Flow Begins Here -->
        <h4>Persona Based User Case Scenario: Ordering Flow </h4>
        <p>Now that I had gotten an MVP of the seating flow tested, I moved on to the ordering flow-- a much more complex flow with many nuances.</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: bold">(Problem)</span> For customers at the restaurant, the ordering process is oftentimes riddled with overwhelming choices. When the waiter appears at the table, customers may decide they want one thing initially, but after ordering and hearing what other people are ordering, they may decide to change their order. Even when an order is already processed, there's also a chance that the customer may suddenly desire to cancel their order.</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: bold">(Problem)</span> For waiters, the confusing decision making process that customers go through also befuddles the waiter taking the order. In addition to customers potentially talking out of order and interjecting additional orders, waiters also have to keep track of specific order details such as additional condiments, spice levels, etc.</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: bold">(Design Opportunity)</span> If we can simplify the ordering process and give waiters the power to take orders in a similar fashion to having a conversation, in addition to the power to modify each order as he/she proceeds, this will allow the waiter to be more efficient. In addition, if waiters are able to check on the status of each meal without running to and fro the kitchen, this will also increase transparency in when the meal will be served. </p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: bold">(Entry Point)</span> Waiters will be empowered through the Toast POS and be able to take orders as though they're transcribing a conversation. Waiters will also be able to view the status of each meal, accurately informing customers of status as they modify each order on the go.</p></br>
