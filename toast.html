				<h4>Reimagining the Restaurant Experience</h4>
				<img width="50%" src="images/uxportfolio/toast/toastcover.jpg">
				</br>

				<div style="display: inline-block; text-align: left">
					<h5>The Challenge </h5>
					<p>Ever arrive at a restaurant only to put your name down and have an hour estimated waiting time? What if waiting in line for a restaurant was a much smoother, stress free experience? In this challenge, I aimed to tackle two main flows: ordering and seating, to eliminate the stress of waiting hungrily. </p>
				</br>
				</div>
			</div>

			<div style="text-align: center;">
				<div style="display: inline-block; text-align: left">
					<h5>Persona Based User Case Scenario: Seating Flow</h5>
					<p><span style="font-weight: bold">(Problem)</span> Customers of the restaurant often arrive at a restaurant hungry and have to endure a long wait to get their food. There is a lack of perceived transparency for wait time between restaurant and customer. </br> </p>
						<p><span style="font-weight: bold">(Problem)</span> Waiters at the restaurant input the customer's name and do not have an efficient way of allocating empty tables and estimating accurate wait time to the customers, which starts a stressful cycle of customers being impatient and continuously checking to see what place they are on the list.</p>
					<p><span style="font-weight: bold">(Design Opportunity)</span> If we can improve this flow and accurately gauge wait times as well as streamline the seating process, customers satisfaction will increase and waiters will also be able to focus on serving the customers rather than managing the wait time. </p>
				<p><span style="font-weight: bold">(Entry Point)</span> Waiters will be empowered through the Toast POS and subsequently be able to inform customers accurately of their wait status and seat them efficiently.</p>
			</br>

			</div>
			<div style="text-align: center;">
				<div style="display: inline-block; text-align: left">
				</br>
					<h5>Persona Based User Case Scenario: Ordering Flow</h5>
					<p>Now that I had gotten an MVP of the seating flow tested, I moved on to the ordering flow-- a much more complex flow with many nuances.</p>
	        <p><span style="font-weight: bold">(Problem)</span> For customers at the restaurant, the ordering process is oftentimes riddled with overwhelming choices. When the waiter appears at the table, customers may decide they want one thing initially, but after ordering and hearing what other people are ordering, they may decide to change their order. Even when an order is already processed, there's also a chance that the customer may suddenly desire to cancel their order.</p>
	        <p><span style="font-weight: bold">(Problem)</span> For waiters, the confusing decision making process that customers go through also befuddles the waiter taking the order. In addition to customers potentially talking out of order and interjecting additional orders, waiters also have to keep track of specific order details such as additional condiments, spice levels, etc.</p>
	        <p><span style="font-weight: bold">(Design Opportunity)</span> If we can simplify the ordering process and give waiters the power to take orders in a similar fashion to having a conversation, in addition to the power to modify each order as he/she proceeds, this will allow the waiter to be more efficient. In addition, if waiters are able to check on the status of each meal without running to and fro the kitchen, this will also increase transparency in when the meal will be served. </p>
	        <p><span style="font-weight: bold">(Entry Point)</span> Waiters will be empowered through the Toast POS and be able to take orders as though they're transcribing a conversation. Waiters will also be able to view the status of each meal, accurately informing customers of status as they modify each order on the go.</p></br>
