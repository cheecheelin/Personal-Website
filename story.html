              <h2>The Unabridged Story</h2>
              <p>I spent the first decade of my life in Silicon Valley, daughter to an engineer. Surrounded by the hub of innovation and brought up in a household that digitized everything through the newest tech products and gadgets, I was encouraged at a very young age to <span style="font-weight:bold">be a builder </span>and stretch my creative side. Every Christmas morning, I would be overjoyed to discover a new robot kit from Santa, or another set of tools that would empower me to create.</p></br>

              <p>Fast forward a couple of years (after a stint in Taiwan where I learned to speak Mandarin), and I entered <a href="http://www.ucla.edu">college</a>. My inherent curiosity in how the world worked and why people behaved the way they did pushed me to pursue a degree in Communications with a specialization in Computing. The blend of the social sciences and technology fascinated me, and this unique combination allowed me to both <span style="font-weight:bold">understand people and use the fluidity of code</span> to develop experiences.</p></br>

              <p>My first year of college, I was drawn into a project where the designer suddenly backed out. This unfortunate predicament left my team scrambling: we had no assets, no backup designer, and we had to turn in flyer designs to our sponsors on a tight timeline. Having always had an interest in digitizing my doodles, I stepped up into this role and became Photoshop-literate. This initial exposure to Photoshop paved the way for me to <span style="font-weight:bold">develop my skills in the rest of the Adobe Creative Suite</span>. Surprisingly, this turned into a slew of opportunities, as my work was noticed and a number of student groups started approaching me to do design work for them. This opened my eyes to how this <span style="font-weight:bold">accidental side gig could actually turn into a career</span>.</p></br>

              <p>Shortly after, <a href="http://www.apple.com/education/campusreps/">Apple</a> hired me to represent them on the UCLA campus, and this served as my first exposure to Silicon Valley. As an employee of the company, I was able to firsthand experience the culture and innovation in technology. I always had had an immense respect for Apple’s products, starting from my very first Apple product: the iPod Nano 1st gen. This position, whilst it was simply a field marketing (sales) position, required me to develop a thorough understanding of the Apple products on the market, and exposed me to the meticulous culture of perfection. Apple’s emphasis on an exemplary experience truly stuck with me long after I graduated that position, and it prompted me to think about how technology should be: not just machines that do human’s biddings, but actually an experience, and a beautiful, carefully crafted one at that. This exposure sparked my interest in the product side of technology: while selling a product allowed me to speak to the product’s strengths, I decided I wanted to be on the <span style="font-weight:bold">product side</span>, actually contributing to building out beautiful experiences.</p></br>

              <p>Guided by my experiences at Apple, I took a Product Manager Intern position at <a href="http://www.belkin.com">Belkin</a>, which allowed me to understand the development processes in place for building out a tech product. Over the course of the summer, I collaborated closely with development and design to build out 6 (hardware &amp; software) keyboard products, most of which are still available today in Best Buy and on the App Store. This was an incredible experience, as it allowed me to have visibility into both the software and hardware development cycles, as well as the different roles that came into play. This internship <span style="font-weight: bold">verified my interest in software</span>, as well as potentially exploring more of the how a product was built, rather than running the timeline and business plans.</p></br>

              <p>The next summer, I joined <a href="adobe.html">Adobe as an Optimization Consultant Intern</a>, eager to try something different in the product lifecycle. As a consultant, I supported the Adobe Target tool, which allowed businesses to run data driven A/B tests on the most valuable online real estate they had— their homepages (and other websites)— in a low-risk environment, and validate their design and content decisions without having to alter the backend of their websites. Over the course of the summer, I spearheaded the strategy for a yearlong testing plan on a <span style="font-weight:bold">major social media giant</span>. This involved merging my skill sets in design, analysis, and communication. The end of the twelve week internship culminated in a presentation at the company’s headquarters, which was well received. (Many of the tests I helped develop are now live on their site!) Being at Adobe— at the company that empowered millions of designers— allowed me to develop my interests in design further and also showed me the <span style="font-weight:bold">value of validating design decisions with data</span>. I also had the opportunity to sit down with many Adobe designers over coffee, and that ultimately confirmed my interests in <span style="font-weight:bold">pursuing a career in product design</span>.</p></br>

              <p>After returning to UCLA, I utilized my sparse course schedule of senior year to take additional classes of interest and pursue projects I wanted to build. I joined <a href="http://www.uclacreatives.io">Creative Labs</a> and spearheaded the design on <a href="http://www.visualizingla.com">VisualizingLA</a>, a data visualization project that attempted to tell a story of LA’s transportation data. I also am working on <a href="http://www.lahacks.com">LA Hacks</a> as part of the design team, specifically focused on the <a href="lahacks.html">redesign of the grading and application portal</a>. I also filled the gaps in my schedule with design courses, including fundamentals in design such as typography, and additional courses in <a href="saveapp.html">Mobile UI design at UCLA Extension</a>. These opportunities allowed me to understand design from a more research-focused perspective, and once more pulled in my skills from Communications to understand how to design with the end user in mind.</p></br>

              <p>Nowadays, I’m busy working on my <a href="http://www.iri.ucla.edu">IRI Project</a>, a <span style="font-weight:bold">user experience study on m-commerce</span> made possible by a generous grant from the Internet Research Incubator at UCLA.</p></br>

              <p>In my last year of school, I’m also actively expanding my skills in interaction design, experimenting with Framer and Origami to create meaningful interactions. I also supplement my learning through attending conferences such as Adobe MAX and Convey UX. I’m incredibly interested in working towards designing for augmented reality, and am exploring this area through playing around in Unity in my spare time! I also enjoy lettering &amp; <a href="http://www.behance.net/cheecheelin">designing snapchat filters<a/>.</p>
