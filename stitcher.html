      <h3> Stitcher Product Challenge </h3>
      <div class="projectimage">
        <img src="images/uxportfolio/stitcher/stitcherscreens.png"/>
      </div>

      <div>
      </br>
        <h4>The Challenge</h4>
        <p>Podcasting has gained popularity recently thanks to the rapid growth in smartphone use and the rise of wildly popular content like Serial. However, the technology that supports the creation and distribution of podcasts has evolved at a much slower pace compared to other mediums. Stitcher is one of the most widely used podcast platforms on the market right now. </p>
        <p>Act as Stitcher's lead PM and assume listeners who interact with other users have a better overall experience. Determine:
          <ul class="quote">
            <li>The first feature to build to test this assumption and why</li>
            <li>How this feature looks and behaves</li>
            <li>Discuss tradeoffs, risks and metrics for success</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
      </br>
        <h4>Understanding the Challenge at Hand</h4>
        <p> To start off, I needed to clarify the parameters of this hypothesis: "Listeners who <span style="font-weight: bold ">interact</span> with other listeners have a <span style="font-weight: bold">better overall experience</span>". I would need to operationalize the definition of "interact" and "better overall experience".</p>
        <p> <span style="font-weight: bold;">Interact</span> </p>
            <ul class="quote">
              <li>Liking / Reacting (Stitcher already has the 'favoriting' feature)</li>
              <li>Curating (Stitcher already has the 'stitch together podcasts' feature)</li>
              <li>Sharing &amp; Discovering</li>
              <li>Commenting &amp; Discussing</li>
            </ul>
          </br>
        <p><span style="font-weight: bold; ">Better overall experience</span></p>
            <ul class="quote">
              <li>Increased satisfaction with the app (Could be measured via a rating popup)</li>
              <li>Increased usage/retention of the app</li>
              <li> Increased engagement with functionality of the app (Could be measured with increased time on screen)</li>
            </ul>
    </br>
  </br>
      <div>
        <p> Now that I had determined a number of possible paths these definitions could take, I decided to delve deep into the needs of the user to thoroughly determine what feature I would build to test this hypothesis.</p>
      </div>
      </br>
        <h4>The Process</h4>
        <p>I decided to adopt a <span style= "font-weight: bold">DESIGN THINKING </span>framework to tackle this problem. (Inspired by: <a href="https://designthinking.ideo.com/"> IDEO </a>)</p>
        <div class="projectimage">
          <img src="images/uxportfolio/stitcher/designthinking.jpg"/>
        </div>
    <!--  <div class="projectimage">
        <img src="images/uxportfolio/stitcher/stitcherprocess.jpeg"/>
      </div> -->
      </br>

        <h4 style="color:#FA646E">1. Empathizing</h4>
        <p>THE KEY QUESTIONS: Who are the key users of Stitcher? Why would a user possibly be interested in a social interaction aspect in a podcast app?</p>
        <p> To answer these questions, I conducted three user interviews. (In the interest of time, I only interviewed 3 people but in a real development setting, I would probably aim to collect data from a larger user base.) Demographics are as follows: </p>
        <div class="projectimage">
          <img src="images/uxportfolio/stitcher/personas1.jpg"/>
        </div>
        <p> These user frustrations led me to the next step in the process, Defining. </p>
      </br>
        <h4 style="color:#FDB83B">2. Defining </h4>
        <p> From the information gathered through the user interviews, I was able to define the <span style="font-weight:bold">user needs and goals</span> as follows:</p>
        <div class="projectimage">
          <img src="images/uxportfolio/stitcher/users.jpg"/>
        </div>
      </br>
        <h4 style="color:#47E8B1"> 3. Ideating </h4>
        <p> In the process of brainstorming new features to address these user needs and goals, I came up with quite a few ideas, including the following: </p>
        <ul class="quote">
          <li>Integrations with wearables (headphones, apple watch etc. since their hands are busy) to bookmark/highlight/annotate their favorite sections in a podcast and share with other users</li>
          <li>Real time transcribing of comments (while a podcast is playing) and having 'pings' to let fellow listeners know key sections provoked discussion </li>
          <li>A chat section to encourage discussion in each podcast (similar to NYTimes articles comments)</li>
          <li>A discovery and recommendation engine so listeners can follow 'influencers' with good taste in podcasts</li>
        </ul>
        <p> [Market Research]: I also looked at other interaction in different forms of media consumption, including Facebook Live Streaming, Medium highlighting and commenting, Twitter reactions, YouTube time-comment linkage, Quora blogging, and Instagram/ Spotify Discover. </p>
        <p> After evaluating all of these ideas, I decided to choose <span style="font-weight: bold">'Discovery'</span> as the main feature to develop, since it most closely addressed the user needs I had uncovered in my user interviews. Discovery would provide additional value add in interacting with other users since it would save users time (in sifting through content), empower them to discover new content, and develop an emotional connection with the community (bonding through love of similar topics of interest). This feature would also address the gap in Stitcher's current product features and expand upon the two key advantages Stitcher already does well: Stitching and Favoriting.</p>
        <p> Validation of Hypothesis: To test whether this feature would actually better the overall experience, I decided to implement an A/B test on the existence of this feature. Group A would have the current Stitcher app (without the new discovery feature) and we would test this against Group B (Discovery feature) and measure for metrics such as 1)how people engage with the feature and rate of return 3) what demographics are engaging. </p>

      </br>
        <h4 style="color:#28B0CE">4. Prototyping </h4>
        <p>To start thinking about possible layouts and functionality of the features to be tested in Group B, I first made the following assumptions and identified the following constraints in the interest of this exercise:</p>
        <p> Assumptions:</p>
        <ul class="quote">
          <li>Users are open to listening to podcasts as a valid form of content consumption</li>
          <li>Users who utilize the facebook social login feature on the current Stitcher app are open to interacting with other users</li>
          <li>We can utilize the Facebook API (since Stitcher already implemented a social login) and access a user's friends list and interests</li>
          <li>Stitcher has the resources to mass A/B test</li>
          <li>Stitcher has a large enough following for a statistically significant result in A/B testing</li>
        </ul>
        <p> Constraints:</p>
        <ul class="quote">
          <li>The current home screen in Stitcher has to stay the home screen because of paid content issues</li>
          <li>We are developing this feature for when users are actively using the app (ex. their hands are not busy doing something else)</li>
          <li>In this iteration we will not place accesibility as the first concern, though it is still of importance</li>
        </ul>

        <p>I sketched out a number of ways a user could possibly discover new content: 1) through a social feed 2) through an influencer's profile.</p>
        <div class="projectimage">
          <img src="images/uxportfolio/stitcher/processshot.jpg"/>
        </div>
      </br>
        <p> To fully flesh out my ideas further, I mocked up the concept in high fidelity using Sketch and basing it off of the current style of the Stitcher app. The following slideshow is a mockup of the discover feature and its functionality.</p>
      </br>
      <div class="w3-content w3-section" style="max-width:1000px">
        <img class="mySlides" src="images/uxportfolio/stitcher/stitcher_screens.001.jpeg" style="width:100%">
        <img class="mySlides" src="images/uxportfolio/stitcher/stitcher_screens.002.jpeg" style="width:100%">
        <img class="mySlides" src="images/uxportfolio/stitcher/stitcher_screens.003.jpeg" style="width:100%">
        <img class="mySlides" src="images/uxportfolio/stitcher/stitcher_screens.004.jpeg" style="width:100%">
      </div>
      <script>
      var myIndex = 0;
      carousel();

      function carousel() {
          var i;
          var x = document.getElementsByClassName("mySlides");
          for (i = 0; i < x.length; i++) {
             x[i].style.display = "none";
          }
          myIndex++;
          if (myIndex > x.length) {myIndex = 1}
          x[myIndex-1].style.display = "block";
          setTimeout(carousel, 3500); // Change image every 2 seconds
      }
      </script>



        <!-- <div class="projectimage">
          <img src="images/uxportfolio/stitcher/stitcherscreens.001.jpeg"/>
          <img src="images/uxportfolio/stitcher/stitcherscreens.002.jpeg"/>
          <img src="images/uxportfolio/stitcher/stitcherscreens.003.jpeg"/>
          <img src="images/uxportfolio/stitcher/stitcherscreens.004.jpeg"/>
        </div> -->
      </br>
        <h4 style="color:#6A6ACB">5. Testing </h4>
        <p>The next step of this process would be to test and iterate on the design. Ideally, I would like to test the wireframes of this feature on a focus group to garner feedback on the functionality of the discovery interaction feature before releasing it to the public in the A/B test.</p>
        <p> After getting feedback from the focus group, I would build out this feature and roll it out in an A/B test, gathering data on the metrics of success against the control group (no discovery feature) defined earlier: </p>
        <ul class="quote">
          <li>Whether users are engaging with the discovery feature</li>
          <li>If a user uses the discovery feature, does this increase usage of the app?</li>
          <li>How are users engaging with the discovery feature? What demographics are engaging with the discovery feature?</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="projectimage">
          <img src="images/uxportfolio/stitcher/abtesting.jpeg"/>
        </div>
      </br>
        <p> If we are able to see a significant positive trend in increased usage of the app and increased engagement with the community, then I would suggest for Stitcher to roll out this feature to all users.</p>
      </br>
        <h4>Product Feature Prioritization </h4>
        <p>The following timeline balances the user goals, and anticipated development time. It is important to note that since I do not have insight to the overarching long term product strategy, it is harder to immediately determine where this feature build fits into the product roadmap and determine possibilities of immediate monetization. </p>
        <div class="projectimage">
          <img src="images/uxportfolio/stitcher/rollout.jpg"/>
        </div>
        <p>The first feature within Discover I hope to develop would be the curated playlists portion, as Stitcher already has a feature in place for "stitching together playlists". We would need to tap into this existing dataset and utilize Machine Learning to surface content that users would be interested in. After this subfeature is implemented, this would hopefully grow the user base, and therefore pave the way for the social aspect subfeatures such as 'reviewing podcasts', 'recommending', and 'real-time commenting'. Subsequently, network effects would take place and further grow the user base, and provide added value to the 'follow an influencer' subfeature.</p>
      </br>
        <h4> Acknowledgement of Shortcomings In This Exercise </h4>
        <p> As mentioned above, there were various assumptions and constraints taken into consideration when designing this test. However, this is quite an expensive testing method for a product feature rollout, and needs to take into account the business goals of such a feature (how much development/design resources need to be allocated towards this, whether there is a significant way to monetize this feature, and if this aligns with the long term goals of Stitcher). In addition, the prototypes designed above are purely draft one mockups, and have not gone through substantial user testing to determine effectiveness.</p>
      </div>
    </br>
      <h4> Special Thanks </h4>
      <p> This exercise wouldn't have been possible without Phillip An, Elizabeth Chin, Michael Stilton, Elbert Kim, Mike Wang. Many thanks to these people for allowing me to interview them as users and tap into their dev expertise.</p>
