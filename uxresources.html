				<h4>A Year of Self-Learning in Product Design</h4>
				<div style="display: inline-block; text-align: left">
					<h5>The Goal</h5>
					<p>At the beginning of the year, I embarked on a journey to become a digital product designer.</p>
					<p>I had just finished a summer at Adobe as an Optimization Consultant Intern, and while I loved it there, something was missing. Prior to Adobe, I had worked in a number of well known tech companies, including at Apple in field marketing/sales,  at LinkedIn as a writer, as well as even exploring the hardware side of things through a Product Management position at Belkin. Yet through it all, my desire to build and create was not satisfied purely by the business side of technology. As I learned more and more about what User Experience and User Interface design entailed, the more it intrigued me. Product design—with its focus on designing for the user— was solving real life problems, and could be applicable to various different facets.</p></br>
					<h5>The Gap</h5>
					<p>UCLA—while a great institution for research—lacks resources in Digital Product Design. The classes in Information Studies are heavily social-science oriented, Computer Science is primarily theoretical, and the Design &amp; Media Arts department is primarily focused on traditional graphic design. While these disciplines are both valuable areas of knowledge, this left a gap in addressing the current landscape of design, especially designing interfaces within tech. The skills from these classes are transferrable, but still leaves many gaps in succeeding in product design roles within tech companies. The very few UX/UI courses are located in UCLA Extension for a hefty fee, and the concept of design thinking is nonexistent.</p></br>
					<h5>The Opportunity</h5>
					<p>The Internet Research Incubator’s project opportunity was a pivotal moment for me. Aided by the generous grant,  I started teaching myself the fundamentals of design, and set out to become a competent designer in the world of e-commerce and UI/UX. I’ll outline a few ways I accomplished this below, and hopefully this can serve as a guide for students who are currently not a Human Computer Interaction or Interaction Design majors, and also assist to demystify breaking into tech as a designer with a non traditional design background. </p></br>
					<h5>The Breakdown</h5>

					<p><span style= "font-weight: bold">1. Industry Conferences</span>:</br> Throughout the year, I utilized the grant to allow me to travel to different conferences internationally. As the majority of design conferences are industry conferences, and therefore not funded by most universities, I used this opportunity to get out of my comfort zone and see the incredible research that was being done on the future of interaction design. A handful of the conferences I attended included: Adobe MAX, Princeton Envision (future of AR/VR and other groundbreaking technologies), ConveyUX, TEI Japan, and The Next Web.</p></br>
</br>

				</div>

					<div style="text-align: center;">
						<img width="45%" src="images/photos/tei.jpg"/>
					</div>
					<div style="display: inline-block; text-align: left">
					</br></br>
					<p>Here’s a photo from TEI 2017—by far my favorite conference. The Tangible Embedded Interaction conference took place in Keio University in Yokohama Japan, and I had an absolute blast learning about the different tangible interactions. There were researchers presenting on using water as an interface, another project that transported lemonade virtually through electric signaling, and one that demonstrated the capabilities of interacting with exhibits in museums. </p>

					<p>These conferences provided the perfect opportunity to see the research that was being done in design, and showed the amazing capabilities of design integrated with technology.</p></br>

					<p><span style= "font-weight: bold">2. Classes</span>:</br> In addition, I took the opportunity to take Mobile design courses at UCLA Extension. One of the classes was taught by Ms. Julia Morton, a UX Designer at Fandango. This class helped bring me up to speed on industry standards, the design research process, and various other elements I would’ve never known if I hadn’t been able to build a real live project from the ground up.</p>
					<p> Some of the tools we used in this UCLA Extension course included SketchApp, InVision, UserTesting.com, and in person focus groups/ user testing groups. By walking us through the entire design cycle of an application, and spending time each week to iterate upon each design + a thorough critique session in class, I was able to gain hands on experience in a small group setting as to how I could improve myself as a designer. This was incredibly helpful, especially in terms of being able to speak to the strengths and weaknesses of my designs in interviews. </p>
					<p> In tandem with the UCLA Extension course, I also took a typography class in the DMA department. While this course focused more on expressive typography within graphic design, a knowledge of grid systems and how to utilize serif v. sans-serif fonts, as well as basic rules of how to approach laying out a clear hierarchy, proved to be incredibly useful for understanding the principles of good design. By taking these concepts and applying them to web design, and installing tools such as WhatFont (Google Chrome Extension) and inspecting (Google Chrome- right click- inspect element) other well designed type-heavy websites such as the NY Times and Medium, I was able to break down how other successful websites tackled the elements of good web design through typography. </p></br>

					<p><span style= "font-weight: bold">3. Clubs</span>:</br> Some other activities I participated in throughout the year also allowed me to speed-learn different areas within Design. The most notable of student organizations achieving the education portion of UX/UI Design includes Creative Labs, which utilizes a 10 week development cycle to bring talented devs/designers together and build a finished product. My specific project included visualizingla.com, an interactive website that aimed to tell a story through visualizing data. Special shout out to my team on this, and all the talented devs/designers that worked on this project with me! </p>
					<p>UCLA ACM was also a great community for developers &amp; the technically inclined at UCLA. Although I didn’t work on any specific UI/UX related projects here, the community of developers and the network was really important in hearing about opportunities and meeting like minded design individuals across the board. </p></br>

					<p><span style= "font-weight: bold">4. Side Projects</span>:</br> Some interesting side projects/opportunities also appeared throughout the course of the year, as my design skills proved to be helpful in landing gigs and working on projects that would advance my skills simultaneously. Some of these included: </p>

					<p>Freelance work—as I built my portfolio, I started attracting clientele that wanted me to work on different UI flows for them. This was a great way for me to earn money while gaining experience, and I’ve been able to work on a variety of projects—everything from finance related UI designs to social media app UI designs and enterprise app stores. I also worked at Disney for the Spring quarter, using the knowledge I had gained in mobile UI design patterns to launch a completely new platform that streamlines processes for an internal app store.</p>

					<p>In addition, through the opportunities possible through the year of learning project I embarked on, I was able to land a design fellow position with an NEA (venture capital fund) e-commerce portfolio company for this summer, as well as becoming a KPCB design fellow finalist and numerous other opportunities that came along. I’m excited to be able to take the knowledge I’ve gained from studying different interface design patterns, and further explore motion interface design and conversion through design. </p></br>

					<h5>Resources</h5>
					<p>Below, I’ve compiled links of resources I’ve found particularly useful throughout my journey in learning about UX &amp; UI Design. I hope you find these resources helpful, and feel free to <a href="http://www.twitter.com/cheecheelin"> tweet</a> me if you have any thoughts/comments/suggestions on how to make this list even better!</p></br></br>
