				<h4>ThirdLove Redesign</h4>
				<div style="display: inline-block; text-align: left">
					<h5>The Challenge</h5>
		      <p>*Update: I will be joining ThirdLove this summer as an NEA Design Fellow!* </br>As part of my interview process, I was asked to redesign the ThirdLove desktop homepage and bra shopping page experiences.</p>
				</br>
					<h5>My Approach</h5>
					<p>Throughout the interview process, I discovered that a lot of our discussions centered around personalization, or how we could work upon making the experience more tailored to each individual that visited the site.</p>
					<p>I thus centered my redesign concept around the idea of <span style = "font-weight: bold">personalization</span>. I also fixed some usability/accessibility issues that I had discovered, such as color contrast, information hierarchy, and tried to slim down the content on the site.</p>
				</br>
				<h5>Personalization for the New User </h5>
				<p> For the webpage design below, I am targeting the <span style = "font-weight: bold"> new user </span>, or someone who has never been to the site before. I think fit finder is an incredibly useful tool that educates and helps users understand what they're looking for better, so I tried to give it more prominence as a pop up window. Users can exit out whenever they choose, which would lead to the next webpage design below (if they hadn't completed the quiz).</p>
				<p>In addition, I trimmed down the content so it gives more prominence to 'fit', rather than 'shop'. The current website is much like a beautiful catalogue, but if ThirdLove aims to tackle the modern woman, then the emphasis should be placed upon comfort and the distinguishing factors that make ThirdLove superior. I also made the chat bar a floating tab that will extend out initially (see third screen) and be able to aid customers whenever they choose, consistent across the site. </p>

				<div style="display: inline-block; text-align: left">
					</br>
				</br>
					<h5>Personalization for the Returning User</h5>
			      <p> For the returning user, greater emphasis is placed on new products they might like to try out. The middle section thus has a recommended products panel that will encourage users to try out different bras according to previous selections. In addition, the top nav will display them as logged in.</p>
					</br>
				</div>
				<img width ="70%" src="images/uxportfolio/thirdlove/thirdlove-3.png"/>
			</div>
		</div>
			<div style="text-align: center;">
				<div style="display: inline-block; text-align: left">
				</br>
					<h5>A Personalized Product Page Experience</h5>
					<p> This bra shopping page also places emphasis on the personalization of the experience. At the top, there is a bra builder, which allows users to customize what they're looking for-- first by selecting their bra style, then color, etc. Assuming users are logged in, then the bra finder would be slightly different depending on the best bra for them.</p>
				</br>
				</div>
				<img width="70%" src="images/uxportfolio/thirdlove/thirdlove-4.png"/>
				<div style="display: inline-block; text-align: left">
</br>
</br>
					<h5>Closing thoughts</h5>
		        <p> This redesign allowed me to think about the personalization of shopping experiences for the modern woman. I wanted to focus on making shopping as closely tailored to each person's needs as possible, as different women have different needs for bras. As I was doing this challenge, I also talked to a couple of different women who mentioned their different pain points in shopping for supportive bras, and I think if fit finder could be expanded upon to provide the truly tailored experience, then customers would definitely return!</p>
		        <p> Additional ideas I would've liked to explore but due to time limitations could not included tailoring the shopping experience and making it more inclusive of women of different colors, and fleshing out bra finder. </p>
